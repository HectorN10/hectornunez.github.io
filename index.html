<p style="font-size: 35">My name is Hector Nunez and I created these pictures using the photoshop software and managed to create what I envisioned successfully, although I took many inspirations to piece them all together. My HEX logo is original and came to mind as soon as my assignment was given and played around with the letters, hence why the 'X' looks unique. The Dark Landscape was a hint that color was needed in the pit of darkness that is, the cave. The alter ego collage was many of my hobbies combined in one very image to describe myself and who I am on the inside. The Galaxy Girl was a great creation as a double exposure because I used a posing girl as a template for the galaxy to be contained as an inner background near the mountains. Last but not least is the Purple Paradise, it was my very first assignment as I was playing around with photoshop till I created fire clouds with purple swirls.</p>
