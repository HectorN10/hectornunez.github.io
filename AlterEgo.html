    <h3>My Alter Ego Portrait</h3>
        <img src="Alter%20Ego%20Collage.jpg" width="650" height="500">
        <p>I created this alter ego portrait with many pictures that were inspired by other art to show what I like, all in one picture. This was an early stage production hence why there's barely any originality to it as I try to express myself with popular images people would understand me better with.</p>
